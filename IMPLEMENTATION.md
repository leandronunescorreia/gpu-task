# GPU-Task Implementation Summary

## Overview
This is a toy cross-platform GPU computation engine built with C++ and OpenCL. The project demonstrates how to abstract GPU computing operations across different platforms.

## Components

### 1. GPUContext
- Manages GPU device initialization
- Creates OpenCL context and command queue
- Provides device information
- Falls back gracefully if OpenCL is not available

### 2. GPUBuffer
- Abstracts GPU memory allocation
- Handles data transfers between CPU and GPU
- Supports read-only and read-write buffers
- Automatic memory management

### 3. GPUKernel
- Compiles OpenCL kernel source code
- Manages kernel arguments
- Executes kernels on GPU
- Provides synchronization

## Features Implemented

✅ Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
✅ OpenCL backend for broad GPU compatibility
✅ Simple C++ API
✅ Error handling with informative messages
✅ Multiple example applications
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ CMake build system
✅ Graceful degradation when OpenCL is unavailable

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Examples

All examples are built automatically:

1. **device_info**: Checks GPU availability and shows device information
2. **vector_add**: Adds two vectors element-wise on GPU
3. **scalar_multiply**: Multiplies a vector by a scalar on GPU

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C++17
- **Backend**: OpenCL 1.2+
- **Build System**: CMake 3.10+
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Limitations

This is a toy/educational project. For production use, consider:
- Thread safety
- Asynchronous operations
- Multiple GPU backend support (CUDA, Vulkan, Metal)
- More sophisticated memory management
- Better error recovery
- Performance optimizations

## Testing

The project has been tested to:
- Build successfully with and without OpenCL
- Show appropriate error messages when OpenCL is unavailable
- Compile all examples correctly
- Provide clear user guidance

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add CUDA backend for NVIDIA GPUs
- Add Vulkan compute backend
- Add Metal backend for Apple devices
- Implement asynchronous kernel execution
- Add profiling capabilities
- Add support for 2D/3D work groups
- Implement more complex examples (matrix multiplication, convolution)
